Android Developer Challenge: Helpful Innovation, powered by On-Device Machine Learning + you!

This is the idea about showing the warning or closing camera preview when person is trying to take selfie at exterem danger places. There are many lives gone while taking selfie at danger. Camera preview will be analysed using ML and will warn user regarding the danger zone. 
  Examples:
    Extreme height.
    Dangeoures Positions
    Taking picture during Amusement Park Rides.
    Taking picture/video on moterbike with high speed
    Taking picture with fast moving vehicles, trains.

Usage of Location Coordinates:
Also we can define the latitude and longitude of extereme danger places and if user is in the radius of extereme danger and trying to capture photo or video camera will show warning or stop preview.
